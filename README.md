# HRM Vaccine Finder

This app pulls the latest vaccine appointments directly from the Nova Scotia health database. It was written in Vue and specifically returns appointments in HRM (Halifax Regional Municipality).

The lambda function that makes this app tick is available [here](https://github.com/gwoods22/hrm-vaccine-finder-backend).
